## About This Item 

Larry Armony (Alamoulou) grew up on the Caribbean Island of Saint Christopher (St. Kitts) in a household where music was always present. Like his mother before him and his two sisters, he sang in the Anglican Church choir. His brother was well known locally as a singer and musician, and his father enjoyed entertaining friends and family by playing records from his extensive collection.

Composing came later in Larry's life. After working in amateur dramatic and musical theatre as a producer, director, and drummer, he decided at the age of 40 that Calypso music allowed him to connect with a wider audience. Despite facing some challenges in the Calypso arena, Larry persevered and has since gained recognition for his consistent quality of lyrical content and music, as well as the enduring value of his themes.

[This publication](https://cfbcworks.github.io/Independence40SKN/items/SKN40Book35.html) contains the lyrics (or poems) of Alamoulou's calypsos from the past twenty years. These songs remain fresh and relevant today and have been featured on two cassettes and three CD albums. They can be ordered online for those interested.
