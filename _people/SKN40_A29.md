## About This Item 

Enoete Inanga is a melting pot of talents, cultures, and experiences. Born to Eno L. Inanga and Amorelle E. Inanga, both educators and authors, he was influenced by his parents' passion for teaching and writing. With a combination of quirkiness, humor, wit, creativity, and a deep appreciation for technology, Enoete embodies a serial entrepreneurial spirit alongside a healthy focus on family. As a proud "girl dad," it is no surprise that his first published book was inspired by his daughter.
