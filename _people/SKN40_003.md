## About This Item 

New York Times and USA Today Bestselling Author, Ana E Ross, was born and raised on the Caribbean island of Nevis where she began indulging in romance novels at a very early age––so much so that by the time she was sixteen, she'd read every Mills & Boon, Regency, and Historical Romance novel in the library. 
 
After moving to the United States, Ana taught middle and high school Writing and Literature for thirteen years before resigning from the classroom in 2013 to follow her dream of writing fulltime.
 
Ana now writes steamy, contemporary, billionaire romances featuring alpha heroes and strong, independent heroines who fight and love with equal passion. Her published works include several short stories, five books in her bestselling series, Billionaire Brides of Granite Falls, and three books in the spinoff series, Beyond Granite Falls. She is currently working on her third series, Billionaire Island Brides, set in the South Caribbean.

A hopeless romantic herself, Ana hopes that each and every one of her readers finds a love like those of the characters whose stories she writes.
