## About This Item 

Godwin Browne was born on the island of Nevis. He grew up and received his education in Nevis. After leaving school he worked in the construction industry. In 1973, his employer asked him to go to St. Kitts to build a family home. That was how he got the opportunity to move to St. Kitts. Not long after he settled in St. Kitts he got saved, and joined a local church, The Church of God. He was committed to his faith in Christ.  It was in that church that he met his future wife, Louise Crosse. They were married, and had three children. After a long married life of thirty-nine years, Louise passed away. Godwin’s children are now grown, with two of whom are married. Godwin studied theology at The World Impact Bible Institute. He is an evangelist and the author of several books including “The Choice is Yours,” “Leadership in Politics,” “Danger of Fear,” and “Faith.”
