## About This Item 

Jihan Williams is an author, attorney and social advocate from the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis. She has spent the last two decades heavily involved in professional and personal activities focused on empowering young people and women through creative arts and civic engagement. After suffering the devastating loss of her son after 26 weeks of pregnancy, she turned to writing as her emotional outlet. On November 23, 2021, the day that would have been her son’s first birthday had he lived, she launched her self-published book “_Lifting the Weight of Miscarriage: Healing Insights on Pregnancy Loss for Sufferers and the People Around Us_.” The book chronicles the first six months after her loss and seeks to offer helpful insight to help other pregnancy loss sufferers and the people around them navigate the experience with more compassion and healing. Readers have described it as “unputdownable,” “brave” and “a practical guide for healing from pregnancy loss.”
