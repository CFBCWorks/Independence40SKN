She attended the University of the West Indies (UWI) Cave Hill gaining a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Educational Administration. She is a past student of the Combermere All Age school (now the Violet O. Jeffers-Nicholls Primary School).  Mrs. Jeffers-Elliot published an anthology of poems entitled, _[Reflections: A Journey to Retirement](https://cfbcworks.github.io/Independence40SKN/items/SKN40Book27.html)_.

In addition to writing and reciting poems, the author has assisted in training students for elocution contests. The highlight of her efforts was the winning of all three trophies by the Violet O. Jeffers-Nicholls Primary School for the twenty-fifth anniversary of St. Kitts-Nevis Independence in 2008. It was an exhilarating moment for the school and the community.
