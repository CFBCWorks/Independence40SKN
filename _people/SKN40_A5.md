Whitman Browne  Biography
Whitman Browne was born, and grew up in Butlers Village, Nevis.  He became a Pupil Teacher at White Hall School, at the age of 14.  After attending teachers’ college in Antigua, 1966 - 1968, he was assigned to the Combermere School.  It was while teaching at Combermere School in 1970, that the ferry Christena sank, killing almost 250 people aboard.  He lost students, family, and friends in that tragedy.

During 1971, Browne was offered a scholarship to study for a Bachelor’s Degree at Ursinus College in Pennsylvania.  He was awarded credit for his work at the teachers’ college, and received a BA degree in history in 1973.  After Ursinus College, Browne studied at Lehigh University, in Bethlehem, PA. and taught at Dieruff High School, in Allentown, PA.  He was awarded an MA degree in education in 1975.  Then, Browne retuned to St. Kitts-Nevis, during 1976, and worked at the Teachers’ College on St. Kitts, for one year.  In 1977, he received a scholarship to Temple University, and returned to Pennsylvania.

From 1977 until 1980, Browne was a graduate student at Temple University.  He also worked with the Allentown School District as Director of the Social Studies Program. In 1980, because of unforeseen circumstances, Browne interrupted his Ph. D. program, at Temple University, and returned to St. Kitts - Nevis.  He worked briefly at the Teachers’ College, then at the Development Bank.  In 1984, Browne migrated to the US Virgin Islands to work with the Department of Education. 

He continues to reside in the US Virgin Islands.  During his time here, he has taught in the public school system, worked as assistant school principal, Governor’s assistant, school principal in private and public schools.  He served as a part-time professor, at the University of the Virgin Islands for an extended period.  Browne also went back to graduate school and completed a Ph.  D. Degree at Walden University.

During his years in the US Virgin Islands, Browne continued to work in two other areas of his interests, writing and photography.  To date, he has written numerous newspaper columns, and ten non-fiction books.  Two of them are still in the process of being published. There are also ongoing plans to publish some of his photography as picture books or photo albums of the US Virgin Islands, and of St. Kitts-Nevis.
