## About This Item 

Kishma Isaac is a respected educator, a Women's Empowerment advocate, and a loving mother of three sons. Among her commitments are mentoring at-risk students, writing poems and contributing generously to daily devotional platforms. She has been teaching for over twelve (12) years, and is an alumna of the Clarence Fitzroy Bryant College, Teachers Division in St Kitts.

Kishma loves gardening, serving the elderly, singing, and directing children's choirs. She lives by her mantra, "A positive mindset makes breakthroughs possible‚Äù. She is the author of "_[Screaming For Your Touch](https://cfbcworks.github.io/Independence40SKN/items/SKN_IN48.html)_," a moving collection of poems that offer guidance on finding solace and self-discovery through personal and spiritual growth.

Today, writing is still a place of solace and naked unfolding. I hope that my poems can provide a voice for the voiceless, comfort for the vulnerable, a break for the captive, hope for the weary, and company to those who feel alone. As I was inspired to travel to enchanted regions of my imagination, I envision that reading this book, you will feel free to speak out, live your destiny and find your happy place. In the middle of vicious or victorious circumstances, the thirst of your soul can be filled, with a poem waiting to be born.
