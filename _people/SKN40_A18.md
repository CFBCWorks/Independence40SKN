## About This Item 

Marcella B. Queeley-Jones is a wife, mother of four and grandmother of four. From her earliest recollection, she had a desire to teach and also a passion for music and poetry. Her love for the creative arts was incorporated into her lessons during the forty-three years she spent in the classroom and Principal's offices of several schools both in the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis as well as St. Thomas, USVI.

Throughout the years Marcella has composed hundreds of poems and songs which are often used during patriotic programmes in our local schools and community events. 

To date she has published three collections of poetry/ rhymes and songs namely: “[Journey](https://cfbcworks.github.io/Independence40SKN/items/SKN_IN39.html)” … “[Rhythm Time is Fun Time](https://cfbcworks.github.io/Independence40SKN/items/SKN_IN40.html)” …and “[Say It With Song](https://cfbcworks.github.io/Independence40SKN/items/SKN_IN41.html)” …Marcella is currently retired but continues to use her teaching and oratorical skills at her local church.
