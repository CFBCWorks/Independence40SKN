## About This Item 

Vanessa Webbe grew up in Cox Village, Nevis in an extended family with her grandfather, mother, siblings and cousins. Her grandfather, the late Daniel Webbe, was her hero, not just for the loving way in which he cared for his family but also for the way he took time out to share interesting, exciting stories about how he grew up with his family. These story telling sessions were inspiring and saturated her childhood with many memorable and happy moments. 

Subsequently, Ms. Webbe wishes to evoke happy feelings and impart positive messages through her writings to the readers, most especially the children. She is the author of _[How About Poetry for Dessert?](https://cfbcworks.github.io/Independence40SKN/items/SKN40Book28.html)_, a collection of poems with a Caribbean flavour for the family table.
