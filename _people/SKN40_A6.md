## About This Item 

Lynell Nolan Biography
Lynell Nolan is the author of “Being Black in Scarlet” and “Growing up in Nevis”.  While growing up in the village of Mount Lily in the Parish of St. James, Nevis and experiencing the hardship of that period, he had no idea that he would later head several organizations, both at home and in Canada. He did not expect that he would have had the opportunity of being on the faculty and executive at three medical universities. Neither did he expect that he would be a representative of the people of Nevis as a senator in the Nevis Island Assembly.
