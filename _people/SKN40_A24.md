## About This Item 

On the 8th of October 1974, St. Kitts experienced what was termed the worse earthquake in its history. Also, on that day a 10-pound baby was born and named Romaine Belgrove. He was raised in a poor family with an abundance of love for each other. Mr. Belgrove was interested in most sports, particularly soccer and basketball. During most of his school years he was selected to recite poems and to act parts in school plays. He later began to compose his own poems and feels he has been given this talent by God to spread good cheerful hope. 

Mr. Belgrove also has a great love for music and is a member of the St. Kitts-Nevis Defense Force Band. 

He describes himself as a fun-loving person who likes to make others laugh, and also as a leader who looks out for his fellowmen and women.
