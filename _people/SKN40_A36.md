## About This Item 

Enoete Inanga is a multi-talented author with a unique blend of quirkiness, humor, wit, creativity, and an aptitude for serial entrepreneurship. Influenced by his parents who were both educators and authors, Enoete has a deep appreciation for technology, teaching, and family. As a proud girl dad, his first published book, "_The Becoming Of Adiaha Inside Out_", was inspired by his daughter and takes readers on an imaginative journey exploring the complexities of life before the creation of life itself.
