### About this Item 

Kishma Isaac’s book, "_Screaming For Your Touch_” is a deeply enriching invitation. Readers
are gently asked to journey from hopelessness to hope, in their universal struggles for meaning and peace. Expressed through raw feelings and burning urgency, you will discover the paradox of knowing love, yet, going after it. The author offers practical advice centered around sunny and stormy experiences on how to find solace, when everyone around you is screaming for relief.   

This book is not merely a combination of rhymes and rhythms, proses and
Paragraphs. It is a glimpse into the personal, aspirational, and spiritual dimensions of building self-confidence through rhythms, prose, and paragraphs.  The most vital aspects of being human, that is, sharing one's mind by giving voice to the rumblings of the soul, are addressed in this book.

Readers are asked to engage the agonies and achievements of living in search of self-discovery. To be healed from our scars is to receive courage from our crushing. The book is written in a readable and realistic way that we are brought into sympathy with others.

Each poem recasts our encounter with confusion and trials and drives us into unselfish surrender to a power loftier than our imagination. The book is structured around three themes of touching self, others, and God.

This book gives depth to poetry and loveliness to our gloom. It shows us that in working through difficulties, we get more than we expect: a garden in which thorns and lilies grow, and where shadows and grief intersect. As God speaks to us, and we communicate with others, these poems give us the grace and power to resist ruin, recoil, and reluctance. 

Read this book and let Teacher Kishma guide you to a place of liberation and triumph.
