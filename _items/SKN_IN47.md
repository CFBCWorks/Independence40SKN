## About this Item 

_I Will Play Again_ reveals a musician Henry, whose father was a Nevisian and mother, a Puerto Rican. By age ten, Henry played the piano and later attended the Free School of Music Academy in Puerto Rico. He founded the Sunstones, a band of teenage players and was later contracted as the bassist in the Reggie Ashby Quartet.

Driven to attain a big name for himself, Henry moved to Miami, USA. He composed over thirty songs, yet he never realized his dream of becoming truly famous. To support his family, he established an interior decorating business, and his music became a ‘side hustle.’ In his late fifties, Henry contracted cancer, which overwhelmed him, and brought much pain to him and his family. His passion and love for music and his wife were unmatched, however. In his hopelessness, that love affair, was the main constant in his life that led him to believe, “_I WILL PLAY AGAIN_”.
