##About this Item 

"This project study was done in St. Kitts & Nevis and captures the efforts of teachers in public Primary schools as it relates to violence prevention. The research journey took the author to the sister island Nevis where data collected also contributed to the findings and conclusions. The focus group discussions in both St. Kitts and Nevis showed the need for much needed violence prevention intervention strategies that would be sustainable and effective in the schools over a period of time. The problem of school violence is real and will continue to prevail. Therefore, knowledge of positive assertive strategies and the whole school approach along with training for all stakeholders is critical to the success and implementation of school violence prevention strategies."
