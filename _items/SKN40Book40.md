## About this Item 

Throughout my thirty-two-and-a-half-year career as a member of the Social Security team of St. Kitts and Nevis, I have long had the opportunity to consider committing to print my own thoughts in relation to several topics and issues relating to the broad subject area of Social Security. With the passage of time, Social Security became for me more of a labour of love than a labour of livelihood; more of a pre-occupation than an occupation.

At some point at the beginning of the 200s, I decided to collate my thoughts and ideas in the form of a book. Thus, the seed for "Social Security ‒ My Topical Reflections ‒ Essays and Issues" was planted.

Even as I now (in February 2017) demit the field of active involvement in the day-to-day affairs of my social security practice, it is my hope that some level of discussions can be generated among others interested in this field. Although my own experience has been largely localized in terms of my practical involvement in social security, I would not wish the discussions to be limited to persons in my own country of St. Kitts and Nevis nor even to the Caribbean region. There may be other social security practitioners in small island states around the world who happen to share the same or similar type of social security systems as we do in the Caribbean. It is my hope that they too will find this material to be of interest.
