##About this Item 

"My Heart Is Speaking is not just another book of Caribbean poetry. The poems in this book are lyrical stories of Caribbean life, with all its struggles, intrigues, and concerns. The book is an open window into one Caribbean/Kittitian writer's concern about the region in which he lives. Silence - My Heart Is Speaking permits readers to look into the complexities of the Kittitian experience, an experience that visitors to these island may not be able to encounter on just a short visit, but that can be touched by the visions and images provided through the poetry on these pages. You are invited to sample pieces of the very lyrical dialect of the native Kittitian so lavishly sprinkled across Tatem's poetry. This book offers an insight into life on St. Kitts and Nevis that no tour guide is able to offer, and upon which Kittitians and their descendants at home and abroad may reflect."
