## About this Item 

_Making Married Life Easy_ is about exposing the fear of marriage being hard. Marriage will work for you if you work for it. This book was birthed out of love and genuine desire to share with both singles and couples. It is intended to provide tools that would assist individuals to adequately plan for successful relationships. God in His infinite wisdom designed marriage between a man and a woman; beautifully crafting both as individuals to become one flesh. The fusion of two sexes, with two different backgrounds, goals, ways of conducting business and so much more—yet having the capability of functioning as a single unit (one flesh). The rising rate of divorce within the Church and having witnessed many dysfunctional relationships, have also prompted the writing of this book.

This book was written with you in mind, whether single, in a relationship or married. It is not intimidating! It is of moderate length, and an easy read, so anyone can comprehend. This life changing resource also includes exercise worksheets, so that you, or together with your significant other, can engage and discuss specific topics.

It is carefully crafted in statistical studies, coupled with real life experiences. It is intended to impart knowledge, wisdom and practical actions to make married life easy. It also provides insight into choosing the right mate, protecting your union, making hard talk easy and much more.

Here are a few quotes:
“Do not be in a hurry to become ‘Mrs. Wife’. Take the time to unravel if he is the right fit for you.”
“Communication is the water that keeps the marriage hydrated.”
“If you create a habit of inviting others into your marriage it would not be easy to escort them out.”
