## About this Item 

_"A Man for Many Seasons"_ is a biographical account of the life, times, and contributions of one of St. Kits and Nevis' most accomplished yet largely unsung heroes, William Ferdinand
'Willy’ Dore. 

The book captures the salient periods and stages of William’s life, and highlights in detail the signal developments in the Nation’s political, economic (especially as it relates to Agriculture), and educational history, both distant and current, which owe their genesis, growth  and success  to the man's input and involvement.

The fact that Dore served in a  plethora of high offices, each with accomplished distinction, not only warrants that his tremendous achievements be documented for posterity, but also justifies his being dubbed '_A Man for Many Seasons_'.
