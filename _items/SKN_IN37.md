This book is written to help readers get an understanding of how important selecting a political leader is. The decisions political leaders make affect every citizen of the country. When one is presented with the opportunity to select a political leader, one must be wise in their selection. Once that leader has won the elections, the citizens also must be happy with their decision. Many citizens have chosen leaders and afterwards are sorry about their choice. This does not have to be the case for you.
