##About this Item 

The poems in _A WALK THROUGH MY MIND_ by [Meredith Warner Phipps](https://cfbcworks.github.io/Independence40SKN/people/SKN40_A46.html) span about 30 years and reflect Kittitian culture, celebration of our awesome lives, and a positive outlook. It is the poet's hope that every poem would serve to empower, entertain and enrich the lives of the readers, and be a powerful reminder that there is still lots of love, laughter, fun and hope in our world. Be blessed and encouraged as you read. “There will never be another now, so l will make the most of today. There will never be another me so l will make the most of myself”. This is the saying that inspired me to start writing poetry at a very tender age and I still write today. Sometimes four lines, sometimes four verses. However, my preference these days is working with young people in the Literary and Performing Arts. Still, poetry will always live on in my heart.
