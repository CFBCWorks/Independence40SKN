## About this Item 

This is the fourth and last book in my Christena series.  It was deliberately written to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Christena tragedy, August 1, 2020.  It was also a means by which to support and celebrate the work of Stevenson Manners and all those who worked with him to create and bring The Christena’s Fiftieth Anniversary Project to its climax.

 The fourth book in the series also relates the tragic story of deaths and losses when the Christena sank in 1970.  However, because it was written to honour the fiftieth anniversary of the ferry’s sinking, many of the photos are updates of some of the events during the anniversary celebration.  More than one of the Christena monuments is included in the photos.

Three special photos I want to be noted, are the pictures of Thelma Parris-Mills, Uhral Swanston, and that of the then six living, past and present leaders of St. Kitts and Nevis.  Mrs. Parris -Mills, was a mere baby when her mother died leaving, she and seven other siblings to face the future.  Despite their loss, the family came together, and that story ended well.  Uhral Swanston was in the center of the fight to transform the politics on Nevis after the ferry sank.  He did lose a brother in the incident, but the pain noted all around the island gave a new thrust to the politics of Nevis.  Eventually, the Nevis Reformation Party (NRP) was created, months after the ferry sank.  The picture of the six politicians is unique.  Probably, that coming together for a photograph, on August 1, 2020, fifty years after the sinking of the Christena, is the only picture available, showing so many present and former leaders of St. Kitts, and Nevis, together.  Unfortunately, Mr. Vance Amory has passed since that picture was taken.  A fourth photo to note is that of the monument on Nevis.  For many years there was no monument on St. Kitts.  After the fiftieth anniversary celebration on Nevis in 2020, Prime Minister Harris, committed to constructing a Christena Memorial on St. Kitts and was completed about late 2022.  That memorial is in the Basseterre Museum, close to Port Zante.  Like those on Nevis, it helps us to remember the Christena, and those who died in that tragedy.
