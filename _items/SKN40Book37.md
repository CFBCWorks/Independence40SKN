##About this Item 

 “The tiny island of Nevis in the Eastern Caribbean is a former British colony once known as the Queen of the Caribees. The 36-square-mile tropical isle retains much of its pristine beauty and remains a favorite place for the more discerning of tourists. However, there is a side of Nevis that the tourists never see. The author presents this Nevis through a series of vignettes, as she experienced life growing up on this island paradise, and the traumatic events that caused her eventually to leave home."
