## About this Item 

'_Musings and Reflections 2_’ is quintessentially an assortment of essay articles which treat multiple subject matters of current or general import.

Some are reflective pieces, while others offer an argument in defense or rebuttal of a particular proposition, and others yet present a factual, research-grounded analysis of stated phenomena.

Together, they extend an insightful glimpse into the philosophical and ideological platforms on which the writer builds his world view and rests his moral underpinnings.
