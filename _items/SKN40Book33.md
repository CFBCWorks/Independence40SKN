## About this Item 

On 18 January 2006, a Welcome Service was held at the Wesley Methodist Chapel in Basseterre, St. Kitts for Ministerial and Lay representatives who had convened to celebrate the Bicentenary of the introduction of the district system into the West Indies.

By happy coincidence, it was also on the 18th day of January in the year of 1787, that Rev. Dr. Thomas Coke, "the Founder of the Methodist Overseas Mission", accompanied by three other English Missionaries, Revs. Clarke, Hammett and Warrener, first set foot on St Kitts.

Methodism has had a glorious past. But the future poses challenges. Can the church itself and in the process recapture its ordained Mission and Vision?

The book concludes with a call to individual commitment. "The future of the Church depends on how each one, whether as Leader or Follower responds to the call of God upon our lives.
