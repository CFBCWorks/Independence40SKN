## About this Item 

Many of our plants provide food, medicines, ornamentals and are used in construction of houses, fishing and domestic appliances. Some still have important natural products locked away, undiscovered. The primary importance of plants to the environment behooves us to institute conservation measures with leads coming from key stakeholders lest we lose some of our best resources. This work builds on previous documentation, Medicinal Plants of St. Kitts and Nevis (2001). The 252 plants described in this publication, _Plants Around Us Part I_ , have been used in various ways in St. Kitts and Nevis. They are arranged in alphabetical order by botanical name. Also included are colour photographs, scientific, local and family names, status, habitat, description and comments on uses and research.
