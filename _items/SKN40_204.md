## About this Item 

_SONNY JIM OF SANDY POINT_ is Simon. B. Jones-Hendrickson's first novel. It ruminates through the memories of  Sonny Jim growing up in the former British colony of St. Kitts & Nevis. The novel is set in Sandy Point with  excursions to the United States Virgin Islands. The traditional tools of fact and fiction to record what life was like growing up under colonialism are used. As the story unfolds, tales of superstition, love and puppy love  and  a strong mother-son relationship are featured. Traditional tales highlighting the situation of a mother who fathers a son  form part of this moving documentary of life in a typical Caribbean setting.
