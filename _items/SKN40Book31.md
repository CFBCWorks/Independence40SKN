### About this Item 

In _Out of Zion_, George Henry Newton has a dream to get out of Zion, a poverty-stricken village in the island of Nevis. Newton ventured abroad and emigrating to the United States. He became a soldier, fought in W.W. II and fortunately, he survived the ravages of the battlefield. During the post-war years, he acquired a career, raised his family and attained a measure of success. However, he fell prey to social ills and died at age fifty-four, but his eldest son did not let his legacy die. Consequently, this gave birth to the long and winding journey "_Out of Zion_".
