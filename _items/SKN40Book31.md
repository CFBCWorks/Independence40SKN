### About this Item 

In _Out of Zion_, George Henry Newton has a dream-to get out of Zion, a poverty-stricken village in the island of Nevis. Newton ventured abroad and emigrated to the United States. He became a soldier and fought in W.W. II. Fortunately, he survived the ravages of the battlefield. During the post-war years, he acquired a career, raised his family, and made his mark. However, they ended up becoming dependent and falling victim to it. He died at age fifty-four, but his eldest son did not let his legacy die with him.
