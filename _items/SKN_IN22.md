## About this Item 

Mr. Ivor Stevens was born on St.  Kitts, but after a time he and some of his family moved to Nevis. Mr. Stevens was not an arrogant man, but he stood for principles.  At one time he was involved in business, but along with his friend Uhral Swanston, both men saw errors in the politics on Nevis and wanted to stand- up for change.  They had problems with how the government on St. Kitts was dominating and demeaning the people of Nevis. The sinking of the Christena, with the great loss of Nevisian lives was a last straw.  Both Stevens and Swanston insisted that change had to come.

It was a slow process, in the March to political change on Nevis. The early political coming together of Swanston and Stevens was with a change for Nevis politics in mind.  Once the two men began to win popularity, and to see a way forward, they agreed to invite Mr.  Simeon Daniel to become a part of their program, and to lead the Nevis politics.  Both Swanston and Stevens agreed that Mr.  Daniel, the lawyer, would be a better leader for Nevis politics than either of them. That stance on the part of both men, was also a great show of respect, and humility too. 

In time, the new political party on Nevis, the Nevis Reformation Party (NRP), was formed, and did come into its own.  Mr.  Stevens was the first person in the NRP to be elected to the government on St. Kitts.  For the first few years they were in the opposition, but in 1980, they became part of the managing government for St.  Kitts - Nevis.

Despite having deep roots in St. Kitts, Mr.  Stevens did all that was possible to represent Nevis well. He was also one of the first ministers of the independent government, after the two islands chose to become an independent nation in 1983. But Mr.  Stevens insisted that Nevisians should always have the right to break away if they do desire. Most people remember Mr. Stevens as a faithful, honest politician.  He was above board in all his dealings and despised the idea of accepting bribes for political favours.  He was respected and admired by many Nevisians for his forthright and honest service.  And he got the support of all his family.  No one can say Mr.  Stevens did not contribute effectively to St. Kitts - Nevis government.  However, time moves beyond us all.  Mr.  Stevens died in 1997.
