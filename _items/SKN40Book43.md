##About this Item 

"This book of poems reflects what goes through my mind when I go out to work very early in the morning driving a garbage collection truck. The poems are based on real-life individuals, situations. They seek to give encouragement and to express thanks to God for our blessings. My objectives writing these poems is to encourage others to be reflective, and open minded and to constantly search for deeper knowledge and understanding of life. I hope that my readers will use this book as an avenue to bring some love and affection into their lives and the lives of others, one word at a time."
