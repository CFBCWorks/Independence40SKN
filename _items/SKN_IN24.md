## About this Item 

This book updates and adds to my earlier book, From Commoner To King (1992).  The big tweak in this version is toward leadership.  Robert Bradshaw was not a perfect leader.  He was human, just like all the rest of us. However, my Ph. D. studies focused on Management and Organizational Leadership.  And based on my training, when I look around the world in general, and the Caribbean in particular, I see a great need for good visionaries and leaders.  As a result of my observations, I opted to look back at Bradshaw’s leadership style to note what we can learn, and how we can use his experiences to set the stage in our islands for leadership change, its success, and our ultimate survival into the future.  Leadership should never be just for now.   There should always be visions of leadership for the future, when time has moved beyond us.

Robert Bradshaw was interested in education and he shared that idea around St. Kitts, Nevis, and Anguilla.  A good leader needs enlightenment, but education and enlightenment must be shared within our communities too.  One of the very sad comments on Caribbean leadership today, is the willingness with which many of our leaders accept monetary bribes, while they allow guileful wealthy expatriates, to take and limit the rights of native Caribbean people.  Some of these people are also encouraged to help manipulate local elections. Mr. Bradshaw was not known to accept bribes.  He also understood, “There is no such thing as a free lunch.”  One day those seemingly generous donors will make claims for repayment.  Mr. Bradshaw was very careful about protecting the rights of the masses, the working class on the islands.  He kept on fighting to change their communities in positive ways.

One dimension of leadership which Bradshaw struggled with during the 1960s and 1970s, is still very present in the Caribbean and elsewhere today. This is the issue of restricting political leaders to a limited number of terms. Term-limits is the better, more creative, and future looking form of leadership.  Extending leadership to three and more terms risks the emergence of dictatorship and should not happen in the Caribbean or other places.  No one leader has the only, or best ideas for creative, productive survival into the future.  Furthermore, what happens when leaders who think that way die?   There will be a scrambling to find a new leader.  Then, there is a sense of starting over again. That should never be the case in the twenty-first century.  This is a time when leaders should involve others in the leadership process, share their vision and ideas with other younger people.  And always be aware that time will move beyond them too.  A creative, involved, and shared leadership style is always more successful, impactful and the more meaningful way to lead, particularly in the twenty-first century.
