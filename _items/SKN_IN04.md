## About this Item 

From the author-

This booklet was intended to be a relatively short paper overview of the social security landscape over the past fifty years. It has turned out to be much longer than initially intended. Nevertheless, I hope that most of you will find some food for thought in the discourse, and most importantly, I hope and pray that some of what I have said will lead to the initiation of a debate on the role of the social security safety net today, tomorrow and the day after.
