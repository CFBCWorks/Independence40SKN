## About This Item

This ginormous rat in a unicorn costume is a prized photo in Madison C.'s collection on her mobile device. The rat is her beloved pet, Ennis, whom she has had since March 2022. He is very slow (physically) and eager for attention, and although he hates wearing costumes, in his old age he occasionally allows Madison to adorn him with the unicorn hat, much to his chagrin. 

The primary source has sentimental value. Domesticated rats only live for about two years, and Ennis has noticeably slowed down in the past few months, seemingly metamorphosizing overnight from a spry squishy fellow to a stinky, bony, and lethargic lump. This lump still loves to be pet and doted on, but can no longer jump to the heights he conquered in his youth. Madison anxiously awaits his health to decline more and approach what might be the final few months of Ennis' playful existence. This document serves to remind Madison of the memories they shared together in an accessible fashion.
