##About this Item 

'Musings and Reflections 1' is an anthology of poetic compositions, a presentation of verses, most with a defined rhyme scheme, that captures the poet's experiences, ideas, ideals, idiosyncrasies, exhortations, lamentations, and aspirations. 

They touch multiple themes and topics, target various age groups and social / academic cohorts, and vary in length, tempo, meter, mood, message, density, and imagery. 

The author’s love for poetry was planted during his primary school days at the venerable Basseterre Boys’ School, where / when the indomitable J. O.  Williams' regular quotations, recitations and references to poetic pieces resonated profoundly in their depth and detail. 

The poetic compositions are interspersed with proverbs, adages and quotations designed to elicit laughter or provoke meditative introspection.  

' Musings and Reflections 1 ' presents just a portion of the myriad original works of the author, both preceding and succeeding the publishing of ‘M& R 1 “.
