## About This Item

"This cap is part of a uniform worn by a veteran of WWII.  It includes a jacket and pants which are all the same olive drab color.  The insignia and rank badges include a six-pointed star with an A (US Army 6th Infantry Division), blue and white circle with AA (specalist in anti-aircraft), three chevrons (achieved the rank of sergeant), four gold bars (24 months of service, six for each bar), single diagonal bar (one tour of service, two years), ribbon: red with white stripes (good conduct in the US Army), ribbon: red with rainbow stripes (allied victory in WWII), ribbon: yellow with stripes (Asiatic-Pacific campaign), ribbon: red with blue and white stripes (liberation of the Philipppines), and flying bird in a golden circle (honorable discharge).  Two of the ribbons have tiny stars, which indicate that the soldier participated in more than one phase of that campaign (in lieu of awarding multiple ribbons).  Some of the ribbons and insignia are repeated on the cap.  The AA badge is held in place with a large safety pin, which is visible on the inside of the cap."
