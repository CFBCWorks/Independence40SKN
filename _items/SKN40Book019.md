##About this Item 

 Jacinth Henry-Martin delivers a compelling series of poems in “Dancing in Bondage”. Composed with great zest and conviction, the book is a literary tribute to all those who have succeeded in discarding physical, mental and emotional shackles to metaphorically dance and celebrate life in the face of all its challenges."

 The Poems are liberating and vindicating and paint pictures with words about all aspects of life.
