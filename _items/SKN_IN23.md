## About this Item 

This book is a general reflection on my life experiences growing up on Nevis, and the many years I have spent living away from the island. I was born in Butler’s Village, one of the more easterly villages on Nevis, and the farthest from Charlestown, the island’s capital.  While I was growing up other people on the island laughed at and teased those of us from Butler’s, because our village became dark early in the evenings. They forgot that we were among the first people during the mornings to see and enjoy the sunshine. Most of us at Butler’s Village had a rough time working on and living off the land. Generally, we walked to Zion or White Hall all age schools and had the option to finish school in the seventh grade. I attended White Hall School.  Both at home and in school, the discipline was severe.  Many young people, both boys and girls, did not make it to the seventh grade.  Initially I was not interested in school.  However, an older sister, Esther, got me turned on to reading at about age eight, and that experience changed my life.  I did not attend high school, but I made it to grade seven and became a pupil-teacher at age fourteen. My love for reading helped me up the ladder of academic success.

There were numerous academic challenges, but I was convinced that God was on my side, and He carried me along. As a student in primary school, I had no dreams beyond the usual apprenticeship. My father was a carpenter, but a tough man to work with. So, I chose to learn tailoring instead. However, my selection as a pupil-teacher changed my desire to become a tailor. In time too, I fell in love with academia, and my desire to further my education heightened.  When I started as a pupil- teacher, I had no dreams whatsoever of an academic degree.  University degrees were uncommon and mainly for the upper or middle class. However, as I moved into academia, I kept on reaching for the stars, with a lot of help and inspiration from God.  At times I wondered how I got the scholarships and the high levels of success.  My father helped to finance me too. 

I did go on to achieve a Ph. D...  Over time, I have served as a teacher, school principal, academic administrator, college professor, and the special assistant to a Governor. I have taught in Nevis, St. Kitts, Antigua, Pennsylvania, St. Thomas, and Tortola.  Because other people touched my life and allowed me to stand on their shoulders, I am grateful for the opportunity to pass that experience on to others.  No, my life has not been perfect, and I have encountered several challenges along the way. But I have learned to trust and hold on to God. I keep on seeing Him there beside me, as I reflect on my journey through life, and I cannot ever let Him go. He designed new paths for my life, so that my birth in colonial ignorance, looking after sheep, cows, and goats, walking around barefooted with busted toes and sleeping on ‘lodging’, would not be my long-term destiny. I am also very proud to note how the young people from Butler’s village, and the wide island of Nevis, and from St.  Kitts too, have been accepting the torch to academic enlightenment which has been passed on to them. I am delighted to note that my children have been inspired and are included too! I am now retired, and I look toward the future. But I keep on writing, pursuing photography, and sharing the enlightenment which was lent to me!
