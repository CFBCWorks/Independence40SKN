## About this Item 

This book recounts and updates the information in the first book, “_The Christena Disaster_”.  The original facts remain but this updated version contains information gathered from interviews from other survivors. I also look more closely at the ongoing physical and emotional impact of the disaster, particularly on children who lost a parent during the tragedy, but also on adult survivors. Some of these are highlighted chapters 6 and 7 of the book. The letter on page 136, written by Camella Caines to her dead mother, Claristine Dore, one of the victims of the tragedy, is very emotional.  The first time I read the letter, it made me cry.  I too, felt the pain and loneliness which Camella reflected on so skillfully. Some new pictures were also included in that book.
