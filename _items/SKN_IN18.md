## About this Item 

This book recounts and updates the information in the first book, “The Christena Disaster in Retrospect”.  The original facts about the ferry’s sinking are there. 

However, because I had met several people who told me their names were not included in the government’s list of passengers, I met and interviewed some of those people.  At that time too, I was interested in finding out about the physical and emotional impact of the ferry’s sinking and on children who lost a parent in the tragedy. 

Another interest at that time was to talk with adult survivors and have them talk about how their lives had been during those 25 plus years, after the 1970 incident.  Despite the time distance, there was still a lot of pain in the lives of those survivors, both young and old.  Some of them are highlighted in two chapters about Firsthand Accounts, chapters 6 - 7.   The letter on page 136, written by Camella Caines to her dead mother, Claristine Dore, one of the victims of the tragedy, is very emotional.  The first time I read the letter, it made me cry.  I too, felt the pain and loneliness which Camella reflected on so skillfully.  Some new pictures were also included in that book.
