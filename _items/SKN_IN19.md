## About this Item 

Author <a href="https://cfbcworks.github.io/Independence40SKN/people/SKN40_A5.html">Whitman T. Brown, PhD</a> notes that in 2013, the memory of the Christena tragedy was still a painful experience.  One woman whose husband died on the boat, leaving her pregnant with their second daughter found the years ahead very difficult to survive.  She almost lost her mind. 

Some additional persons have added their reflections about the incident, and how they were impacted by the initial story.  This book contains aspects of the first and fundamental story “The Christena Disaster in Retrospect” but there are also some new interviewees sharing their stories and reflections about the afternoon of August 1, 1970, some forty plus years later. 

There are some new additions about the ferry, the islands’ politics, and other important details. It is an all-round good read about the Christena incident, and about the politics of St. Kitts - Nevis, how it was impacted and re-shaped by the Christena tragedy.
