## About this Item 

By 2013, the memory of the Christena tragedy was still a painful experience.  One woman whose husband died on the boat, leaving her pregnant with their second daughter found the years ahead very difficult to survive.  She almost lost her mind. 

Some new, scholarly people added their reflections about the incident, and how they were impacted by the initial story.  There are aspects of the first and fundamental story, but there were also some new interviewees sharing their stories and reflections about their experiences in life, and how they remembered the afternoon of August 1, 1970, after forty plus years. 

This book continues to keep the original story of the ferry’s sinking intact.  However, there are some new general additions about the ferry, the islands’ politics, and some other general information. It is an all-round good read about the Christena incident, and about the politics of St. Kitts - Nevis, how it was impacted and re-shaped by the Christena tragedy.
