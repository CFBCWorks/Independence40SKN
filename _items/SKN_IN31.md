## About this Item 

What are the first few months after a pregnancy loss like? What emotions does the woman feel? What experiences triggered her grief and is there anything that the people and institutions around the grieving parents can do to help? 

_"Lifting the Weight of Miscarriage_" is an emotional and raw recount of one woman’s journey in the six months following her second-trimester miscarriage. By exploring her physical, emotional, and spiritual experiences in that time, she offers insight into the often-hidden world of pregnancy loss while providing suggestions to encourage healing that can be useful to other sufferers and the people in their lives.

Although written in a Caribbean context, this must-read narrative is a conversation starter that is relevant to the universal pain of losing a child or children. Healing is possible and this book can help!
