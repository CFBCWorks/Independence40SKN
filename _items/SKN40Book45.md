##About this Item 

"This book is printed from right to left as a cultural pattern. In the traditional African Culture, writings were done and read from the established right to left. The Muslims and other Nations still use this Ancient African pattern of writing. It is cultural practice to always move towards the Heart. This can be seen in the greeting posture of placing the right hand over the Heart, and many other abandoned practices. It is not a coincidence that when the nose is pointing North, the Sun moves towards the Heart. Consequently, Human Beings are known and judged by their hearts.
This practice may seem different and unusual, but when the Universal significance is understood, Human beings can liberate themselves from the practice of moving away from the Heart and a State of Mind which creates chaos. The path of liberation and the eternal freedom of the Human spirit should always be directed towards the Heart, where there is Harmony, Peace, and Love. This book is a symbol to open the door of the heart."
