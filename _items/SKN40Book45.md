##About this Item 

“_The Door Within_”, by Sekou K Rameses, is an exciting collection of ideas and thoughts that reflects the poet’s vision about his sojourn here on Earth.  

He gives us “Reflections,” “Vibrations,” “Hope,” and “Tranquility,” yet like “A warrior,” firm “Like a Tree planted by the Nile,” he uncovers for us “The Atrocities of Life” that can only be answered by “The African Prayer.” 

These poems are a force that can break the chains that enslave the human spirit.

This is a book that you will enjoy even as it frees your soul.
