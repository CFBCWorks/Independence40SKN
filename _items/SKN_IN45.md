## About this Item 

Lynell Nolan's second book “_Growing up in Nevis_” published in 2023 gives the readers a glimpse of what his community was like between the nineteen fifties and the early nineteen seventies before he migrated to Canada. He hopes that this book will serve as both an autobiography during that period and a historical perspective of his community during those years. He felt that with the advent of present technology, there is a need for the present and future generations to appreciate the hardships that were experienced in the past.
