##About this Item 

 “Reflections: “A Journey to Retirement” is an anthology of poems which was published in 2019. The poems were composed by the author, Ermileta M. Jeffers-Elliott, on various topics as she was inspired by a need to assist students in the classroom with something they could relate to. Poems were composed for occasions such as Independence celebrations, graduations, birthdays, harvest cantatas in the church, Poets in the Square, individual tributes and many others.  
One of the objectives of this book was to motivate local authors to capture their thoughts as they were inspired.  Another was the sheer enjoyment of reciting and observing how audiences were captivated into silence and then bursting into an applause of appreciation at the end of a recital."
