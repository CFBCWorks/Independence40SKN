##About this Item 

 “_Reflections: A Journey to Retirement_” is a collection of poems which was published in 2019. The poems were composed by Mrs. Ermileta M. Jeffers-Elliott, and include a range of topics. Mrs. Jeffers-Elliot was inspired by a desire to provide students with poetry they could relate to. The poems cover occasions such as Independence celebrations, school graduations, birthdays, church harvest cantatas, culturama, and individual tributes to outstanding personalities.  
 
In publishing this collection, the author wished to motivate others to write poetry.  She also takes sheer enjoyment in reciting and observing the silent captivation of an audience followed by the burst of applause at the end. A copy of the book can be obtained at www.amazon.com or by calling 1-869-665-0398.
