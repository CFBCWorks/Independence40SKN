## About this Item 

This book of poems reflects what goes through my mind when I go out to work very early in the morning driving a garbage collection truck. The poems are based on individuals, real life situations, encouragement and giving God thanks for what we have or do not have. Every word written on these pages came from my inner deepest thoughts and I chose to share them in the form of poetry. The intention is to get people to open their minds to certain situations, look within themselves and learn about things they had no idea of before and to keep them interested and wanting more information. Lessons can be leant and we can all use this book as an avenue to try and bring back some love and affection in the world one word at a time.
