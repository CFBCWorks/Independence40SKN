### About the Book

Dr. the Right Excellent Sir Kennedy Alphonse Simmonds, the only living National Hero of St. Kitts and Nevis, was the first Prime Minister of this great country. He contested nine general elections—1966, 1971, 1975, 1980, 1984, 1989, 1993, 1995 and 2000—the most in our history since adult suffrage in 1952. Dr. the Right Excellent Sir Kennedy Alphonse Simmonds belongs in the pantheon of National Heroes of St. Kitts and Nevis. He played a vital role in one of the most tumultuous periods in the history of the modern Caribbean, showing poise, grace and dogged determination.
