## About this Item 

The island of Nevis is a bushy place. Wonderfully and beautifully verdant. Trees everywhere. Beyond the bush there is a story. A story of life as it was, of the road that its people have travelled, and life as it is now.

The writer lays out in interesting and sometimes amusing detail the story of life as it was lived on the island in the 1940's-1960's. The songs and poems speak to some aspects of the culture of the island and life as it is today. The final section of the book recounts the story of a tumultuous educational journey by the writer, a journey not unusual for people of little islands such as Nevis.

For the older Nevisian, a riveting walk down memory lane, and for the younger ones, an insight into the life that produced them. A veritable learning experience for the non-Nevisian, a taste of life in this bushy little place.
