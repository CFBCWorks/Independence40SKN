## About this Item 

God’s Signet: Standing in Authority, is a book about self-discovery that serves as a means for the current generation to encounter and embrace their full potential. In this book, Jasmine Browne reminds us of what we can accomplish as God’s Signets on the earth. God’s plan has never changed, she says, “The same mandate He gave to Adam: Take dominion is still our inheritance today as His kingdom people.”
