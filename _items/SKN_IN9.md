## About this Item 

_God’s Signet:Standing in Authority_, is the first in a series of books by the author and it is a book about self-discovery that serves as a means for the current generation to encounter and embrace their full potential. In this book, Jasmine Browne reminds us of what we can accomplish as God’s Signets on Earth. God’s plan has never changed, she says, “The same mandate He gave to Adam: Take dominion is still our inheritance today as His kingdom people.”
