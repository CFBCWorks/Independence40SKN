## About this Item 

In "_Children's Delight_,” the poet, Harvey Hendrickson, holds the view that a feeling for poetry is born within a child and that, if poetry appropriate to a child’s age and aptitude is introduced to him/her at an early age, then a long lasting and satisfying pleasure can be sown which will follow him/her through life. To mark the year of International Literacy Harvey Hendrickson has very thoughtfully dedicated this, his second Anthology of poems, to his children. His contribution is suitable for pupils of primary school age and can enhance teaching. The topics are wide ranging and practical-resulting in, meaningful and straight-forward poems.
