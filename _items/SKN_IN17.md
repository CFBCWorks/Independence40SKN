## About this Item 

This book was published in 1985.  It is the first of my four books about the Christena tragedy of 1970, when the ferry between St.  Kitts and Nevis suddenly sank during the afternoon of August 1, 1970, killing almost 250 passengers from St. Kitts-Nevis, and some from elsewhere too.  I was living on Nevis then, and I can still see some of the horror pictures and desperation, which I saw that afternoon, and for a long time after. 

I still remember that evening as the night when Nevisians at home and elsewhere around the world cried, and cried, and cried.  There were also dead bodies, people looking on in fear, and phone calls to family and friends, beyond Nevis, on the very few landline phones available.  Even our stern, unbending, Premier, Robert Bradshaw, was demolished by the devastation and pain he saw.  That evening he cried with, and for the Nevisians.  In my case, what I experienced that evening, and up until I left Nevis to attend college in the USA, 1971, became an important marker in my life.  While at college in the USA, I kept seeing pictures of pain, and remembering the Christena tragedy.  It was difficult for me to forget that night on Nevis, when so many people died; and those others alive, cried hopelessly.

So, when I opted to write my first book, it had to be about the Christena disaster.  It is a sad part of our island’s history, but I want to ensure that it is remembered forever.  The research was challenging but enlightening.  There were stories of premonitions.  One mother had three children washed from her hands, and beside her, into the sea, but she made it into the sea, and survived the sinking ferry.  While some people rushed to join the ferry to Nevis, others walked off because it was overcrowded.  The ferry was registered to carry 155 passengers but, on that afternoon, there were more than twice that number on board. Many of them could not swim and there were some aboard who were swimmers. Clifford Browne, Laughton Sargeant, Franklyn Browne, Arrington Browne, Luella Budgeon, and Dulcita David, were among those who survived, lived beyond, and managed to talk about that horroring experience they endured that afternoon of August 1, 1970.
