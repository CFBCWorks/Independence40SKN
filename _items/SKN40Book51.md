### About this Item 

“A thought-provoking Christian book by [Godwin Browne](https://cfbcworks.github.io/Independence40SKN/people/SKN40_A17.html) exploring the value of true faith and meaningful actions over seeking mere approval.” 

Sometimes the Christian community appears to focus more on creating a good impression than making a positive impact.  

Jesus encountered this attitude when He came on the scene. He came face to face with a religious system that appeared to be much too focused on creating a good impression (see Matthew 6:1-8).

Our Heavenly Father expects much from the church these last days.... And therefore the church has to be very careful...that they not follow that same trend of the religious system that Jesus met when He came on earth for His ministry.
