## About this Item 

This was the second book I wrote, and it was published in 1992.  Actually, it was a spin-off from my first Christena book.  During my research into the Christena, I began to encounter and learn new information about Mr. Bradshaw.  In time I became intrigued about the man and wanted to learn more.  Since I am from Nevis, I had learned early to hate him.  However, what I began to learn about the man left me questioning my attitude toward him.  Slowly it occurred to me that I was mis-informed and wrong about my attitude to Mr.  Bradshaw.

Mr. Robert Bradshaw went to the seventh grade and not the fifth grade as some people were spreading.   Despite the overwhelming dependence on sugar cane at that time, and the division of society into working-class, and planter-class, Mr.  Bradshaw did all he could to get an education, and he did seek to share his knowledge with others from the working-class.  One of the avenues he saw could ensure change and success for the working-class was the Labour Union.   Early in his life, Mr. Bradshaw brought together education and labour unionism into his thinking and planning for the future.  In time too, he was observed, noted, and respected, for his education, unique commitment to the masses, and to labour unionism.  He came to see it as a powerful force for change in his society, and he was committed to using it as such.

At age 28, Mr. Bradshaw became the youngest, and third leader of the St. Kitts-Nevis Labour Union.  Both his travel and reading, plus his anger toward the exploitation of the working-class, kept him focused on changing the future for the masses.  In time, Mr Bradshaw defied all odds.  He fought for better health conditions, primary and secondary education, better housing, and greater political participation for the masses.   His involvement with the labour union and his commitment to the working-class, transformed the societies of St.  Kitts, Nevis, and Anguilla.  Despite his many leadership successes, including his drive toward independence, Mr.  Bradshaw was an imperfect human being.   He died in 1978, at age 61.  However, his successes and achievements continue to live after him.  Today he is not the only national hero of St. Kitts - Nevis, but Mr.  Robert Bradshaw does stand head and shoulders above all the others.
