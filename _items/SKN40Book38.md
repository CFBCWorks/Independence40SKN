### About this Item 

""_Pregnant These Past 20 Years_" takes readers on a poetic journey to an island paradise called St. Kitts and Nevis. Heather artistically sets the stage for a people once in bondage to showcase their worth, attained through Independence. She describes a people undeterred, dreaming big dreams and overcoming insurmountable odds despite being entrenched in the throes of slavery. She bemoans the sweat dripping from the brows of her people and the pangs of pain they endured for far too long."
