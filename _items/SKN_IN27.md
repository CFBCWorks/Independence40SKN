## About this Item 

“_The Voice of a Caribbean Man_” is not a collection of poems written in a haphazard manner. To grasp and maintain the interest of the reader, the author has portrayed two distinct registers - Standard English and Nevisian dialect, imbued with his own unique style. He catered to the taste of a wide-reading public by drawing from various settings and situations- the abstract, as seen in “_Nature_,” and the very down to earth, as seen in “_Ah Remember Castle_.” His poems are reminiscent of his youth. Harvey borders on the political, he includes cultural and historical aspects, and touches on the environment.
