### About this Item 

"St. Kitts and A Portrait of a Nation Celebrating 25 Years of Independence" charts the evolution of a young nation state from a colony to an independent nation. Dr. Timothy Harris reveals, as only an insider could, the many pitfalls and triumphs experienced during this journey. This compilation of the speeches made to the General Assembly of the United Nations elucidates the changes in the political system of governance, foregrounds the policies on international diplomacy adopted by the government of St. Kitts and Nevis and offers enlightening insights on the emblems of nationhood, their significance and use. This timely publication commemorating the 25th anniversary of the independence of St. Kitts and Nevis is an important reference work not only for the people of St. Kitts and Nevis, at home and in the Diaspora, but also for the entire Caribbean community and beyond. It is an important addition to the discourse on independence and nationhood.
