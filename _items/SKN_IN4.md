## About this Item 

A history of Social Security in St. Kitts and Nevis" yesterday, today, tomorrow" This paper was intended to be a relatively short overview of the social security landscape over the past fifty years. It has turned out to be much longer than I had initially intended. Nevertheless, I hope that most of you will find some food for thought in the discourse above and most importantly, I hope and pray that some of what I have said will lead to the initiation of a debate on the role of what the social security safety net today, tomorrow and the day after.
